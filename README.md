# Hello World edge extension

This is a Hello World extension for Launch. It can be used as a starting template for developing your own Launch edge extension.

For more information regarding Launch extension development, please visit our [developer documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/extension-dev/overview.html). Note the [Scaffold tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/reactor-scaffold) and [Extension Sandbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/reactor-sandbox) will be helpful in developing your own Launch edge extension.

## Development

### Running the sandbox

Before running the sandbox, you must first have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer. Your npm version (npm comes bundled with Node.js) will need to be at least 7.0.0. You can check the installed version by running the following command from a command line:

```bash
npm -v
```

Once Node.js is installed, run the sandbox by executing the following command from the command line within your project's directory:

```bash
npx @adobe/reactor-sandbox
```
